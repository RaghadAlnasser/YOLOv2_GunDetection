This is a YOLOv2 implementation using MATLAB for object detection 

mainly it trains the networks with images and a bounding boxes around any gun, after that it tested with a new images and the output should be the same image with a bouding box around the gun

The original implementation was taking from https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/object-detection-using-yolo-v2.html?s_tid=blogs_rc_6
